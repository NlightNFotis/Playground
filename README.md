Playground
=====

This repository hosts my personal coding Katas, that is
experiments on various language features and my personal solutions programming exercises and challenges
found on various sites such as [codegolf.se](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/)
and [r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer). Those Katas
are done for self {improvement/amusement/education/*}

I will be solving those different Katas (for now) on several languages that interest me,
that is `C`, `C++`, `Go`, `Python` and perhaps `Java`. If I get interested in other
languages in the future I may as well solve these Katas on that language.

Setup
--------

My setup for the various languages is as follows (may be subject to change,
but it should give you a good idea on what I try these on if you want to compile
them for any reason):
 * `Python`: `Python 3.3.2`
 * `C++`: `Clang++ 3.3` or alternatively `g++ 4.8.2`
 * `C`: `Clang 3.3` or alternatively `gcc 4.8.2`
 * `Go`: `go version go.1.2.2 linux/amd64` or alternatively `gccgo 4.8.2`

Contributing
------------

I am doing all these katas as a practice; as a result I will not accept 
outside code contribution. If you would like to use the code in these katas,
feel free to do.

Code Reviews
------------

I will be more than happy to accept code reviews, in the form of bug reports.
If you see anything wrong or something that could be very well optimized feel free
to file an issue.
