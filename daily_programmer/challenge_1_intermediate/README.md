===================================================================================================================

Create a program that will allow you to enter events organizable by hour. There must be menu options of some form,
and you must be able to easily edit, add and delete events without directly changing the source code.

(note that by menu, I don't necessarily mean gui. As long as you easily access the different options and receive prompts
and instructions telling you how to use the program, it will be fine)
